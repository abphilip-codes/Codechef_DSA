# DSA: Easy Problems to Get Started

```
1. Chef went to a shop and buys a pens and b pencils. Each pen costs x units and each 
pencil costs y units. Now find what is the total amount Chef will spend to buy 
a pens and b pencils.

Input:

    First-line will contain 4 space separated integers a, b, x and y respectively.

Output:

    Print the answer in a new line.

Constraints

    1≤a,b,x,y≤10^3

Sample Input 1:

    2 4 4 5

Sample Output 1:

    28

Sample Input 2:

    1 1 4 8

Sample Output 2:

    12

EXPLANATION:

    In the first example, total cost is (2 * 4 + 4 * 5) = 28.
    In the second example, total cost is (1 * 4 + 1 * 8) = 12.

2. You're given a number N. If N is divisible by 5 or 11 but not both 
then print "ONE"(without quotes). If N is divisible by both 5 and 11 
then print "BOTH"(without quotes). If N is not divisible by 5 or 11 
then print "NONE"(without quotes).

Input:

    First-line will contain the number N

Output:

    Print the answer in a newline.

Constraints

    1≤N≤10^3

Sample Input 1:

    50

Sample Output 1:

    ONE

Sample Input 2:

    110

Sample Output 2:

    BOTH

Sample Input 2:

    16

Sample Output 2:

    NONE

EXPLANATION:

    In the first example, 50 is divisible by 5, but not 11.
    In the second example, 110 is divisible by both 5 and 11.
    In the third example, 16 is not divisible by 5 or 11.

number among them.

Input:

    The input consists of three lines.
    The first line contains a single integer A
    The second line contains a single integer B
    The third line contains a single integer C

Output:

    Print the second largest number among A, B and C, in a separate line.

Constraints

    7

Sample Input 2:

    14
    28
    16

Sample Output 2:

    16

EXPLANATION:

    In the first example, 7 is the second largest number among 
    the given three numbers.
    In the second example, 16 is the second largest number among 
    the given three numbers.

5. You're given two numbers L and R. Print all odd numbers between L and R 
(both inclusive) in a single line separated by space, in ascending 
(increasing) order.

Input:

    First-line will contain two numbers L and R

Output:

    Print all odd numbers in a single line separated by space, in 
    ascending (increasing) order.

Constraints
